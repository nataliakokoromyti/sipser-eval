# Solution: Exercise 0.7

## Solution
Step 1:
A binary relation R is Reflexive if for every x, Symmetric if for every x and y, implies Transitive if for every x, y, and z, and implies x
Step 2:
(a)
Reflexive and symmetric but not transitive
: x, y are people and they share at least one biological parent.
? This relation is clearly reflexive, since everyone has their own parents for parents.
? This relation is symmetric, if person x shares a parent with person y, then person y shares that same parent with person
x.
? However, this relation is not transitive. Assume a person m who shares exactly one parent (a mother) with person g and exactly one parent with person(s) (a father). g's father is not s's father, and g's mother is not s's mother. Hence, while gRm and mRs are true, gRs is false.
Step 3:
(b)
Reflexive and transitive but not symmetric
: x, y ∈ N and x − y ≤ 0.
? This relation is Reflexive, because x-x = 0.
? This is transitive, because if then x ≥ y and if then y ≥ z, thus because x ≥ y ≥
z.
? However, this relation is not symmetric, because 5 − 3 ≥ 0, but 3 − 5 < 0.
Step 4:
(c)
Symmetric and transitive but not reflexive
: x, y ∈ Z and i ∗ j > 0
? This relation is Symmetric, because multiplication is symmetric.
? It is transitive, as well, since if then neither x nor y is zero and if , then neither y nor z is zero. Thus because neither x nor z is zero.
? However, this relation is not symmetric, because 0 ∗ 0 = 0
