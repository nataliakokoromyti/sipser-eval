# Solution: Exercise 0.4

## Solution
Step 1:
will have number of elements in it. One of the method of constructing the Cartesian product is to select an element of and pair it with each and every element of B: . This produces the pairings . On repeating this procedure for each remaining element of through . First pairing will produce pairs. As the iteration continues over the elements of A, a number of sets will get generated, each set having b pairs. Thus, the number of elements in is
