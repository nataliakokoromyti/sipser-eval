# Solution: Exercise 0.13

## Solution
Step 1:
Let us consider a graph G which has at least one edge and without having any loops or cycles in the graph. In graph G we would prove that there
are at least two nodes with degree 1 i.e. with equal degree. This conclusion would be taken forward for a graph with 2 or more nodes.
In a graph G we must get a node, say at which only one edge is incident, i.e. . Let be this edge which is incident at . Since
G has no cycles other end of is not . Let it be . If there exists no other edges which is incident at then .
Otherwise let be the edge which is incident at . Arguing similar way and proceeding in this way we get a node having degree 1 and is equal
to degree of . Thus we get that graph G has at least two nodes of degree 1. Thus two nodes have the same degrees in a graph with two or more
nodes.
