## Problem Statement
Ramsey's theorem. Let G be a graph. A clique in G is a subgraph in which every two nodes are connected by an edge. An anti-clique, also called an independent set, is a subgraph in which every two nodes are not connected by an edge. Show that every graph with n nodes contains either a clique or an anti-clique with at least 1/2 log2 n nodes.
