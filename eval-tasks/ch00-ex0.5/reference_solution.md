# Solution: Exercise 0.5

## Solution
Step 1:
Consider the data, Number of elements in set C = c Formula: When the number of elements in the set S is n, then its power set consists of elements. The Power set is the set of all subsets of the set S. The set C contains c elements such as . Substituting, 'c' instead of 'n'. The number of elements in the power set of C is ' ' elements. Example: Assume .So, the number of elements in set C is 4. The total subsets of the set C are: The set of all subsets is called a Power set. Thus, the power set is as follows: The number of elements in the power set is 16 . Thus, when the number of elements in a set C is c, then the number of elements in its power set consists of elements.
