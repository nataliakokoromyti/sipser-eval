# Solution: Exercise 0.11

## Solution
Step 1:
- a) The sum of the first n natural numbers is given by: . Here, induction method is used to prove the above equality. Let's write in shorter form like: .
- For n=1, it is true that .
- For n=2, it is true that .
- In the same way it is true for n . So, finally it has to prove that for n+1 or .
- If n+1 is added to each side of the next identity:
- Which is equivalent to: or So, the above equality proves that the given equality for the sum of n natural or is also true for . Hence the given equality is correct.

Step 2:
- b) The sum of the cube of the first n natural numbers or is given by: The above equality can be proved by induction method. Let's write in shorter form like:
- For n=1, it is true that: or 1=1.
- In the same way it is true for n: . So, finally it has to prove that for n+1 or . Therefore, So, the above equality proves that the given equality for the sum of the cube of n natural numbers is also true for n+1. Hence, the given equality is correct.

Step 3:
From the above explanation: . It is concluded that "the sum of the cube of the first n natural number is equal to the square of the sum of first n natural number".
