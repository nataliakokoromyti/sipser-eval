# Solution: Exercise 0.8

## Solution
Step 1:
An undirected graph is a set of vertices (nodes) and edges where an edge connects a pair of vertices and it has no orientation. Consider the undirected graph Where, V is the set of nodes, And, E is the set of edges, . The graph G is as shown below: Degree of nodes: The degree of a node is the number of edges at that particular node. The degrees of each node of graph G are as shown in the table below: Node Degree 1 3 2 3 3 2 4 2

Step 2:
Path from node 3 to node 4: The path from node 3 to node 4 on the graph G is as shown below:
