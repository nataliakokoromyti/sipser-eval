• It indicates that all the horses present in are identical (that is, the same color) if is not empty which returns always true result except when exactly two horses contained in . Then exactly one horse out of the two horses will be consist in each and .
• Certainly the single horse in and only the single horse in has its peculiar color. Therefore, it has no meaning to conclude that the horses have the same color.
• So the base case should be for value 2 not for 1. Since the base case is false, the above proof is wrong.
