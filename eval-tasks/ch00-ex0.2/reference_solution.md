# Solution: Exercise 0.2

## Solution
Step 1:
a. Consider the given information: The set containing the number of series of 10. It means n contain 10 and 10 to the power of m, contain the series of 0, 1, and 2, is as shown below:

Step 2:
b. Consider the given information: The set contains the all integer number which is greater than 5. Thus, the n which contains only those integer numbers which are greater than 5 is as shown below:

Step 3:
c. Consider the given information: The set contains the all natural number which is less than 5. Thus, the n which contains only those natural numbers which are less than 5 is as shown below:

Step 4:
d. Consider the given information: The set contains the string which is aba. Thus, the n which contains only the string 'aba', is as shown below:

Step 5:
e. Consider the given information: The set contains the empty string. Empty is denoted by Thus, the set which contains only the empty string, is as shown below:

Step 6:
f. Consider the given information: The set contains nothing, it means set contain only null. Null is denoted by . Thus, the set which does not contains anything is as shown below:
