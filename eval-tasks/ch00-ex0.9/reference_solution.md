# Solution: Exercise 0.9

## Solution
Step 1:
Given graph:

Step 2:
Formal description of the graph is ({1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, {(1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6)}) It shows a set of nodes and a set of edges.

Step 3:
In a graph G, we say G = (V, E) where V is the set of nodes and E is the set of edges.
