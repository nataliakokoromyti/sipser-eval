# Solution: Exercise 0.6

## Solution
Step 1:
a)
The value of the function f at n is 2 is 7.
Therefore, the value of

Step 2:
b)
The set of all possible dependent value of the outputs of a function is called the Range.
The set of all possible inputs to the function is called its Domain.
From the given values n, and f(n), the Range and Domain are as follows:
• Range
• Domain

Step 3:
c)
The value in the function , where i is the row label and j is the column label.
Then the value at the row labeled 2 and the column labeled 10 in the table is

Step 4:
d)
The Range of the function g is
The Domain of the function g, which is the input values in the table goes into the function
From the table

Step 5:
e)
• If f is a function of the form , b is the output value when the input value is a
• The entry at the row labeled i and the column labeled j in the table is the value of g (i, j).
• The value of the function f at n=4 is 7, which is
