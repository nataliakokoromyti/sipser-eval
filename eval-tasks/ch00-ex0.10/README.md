## Problem Statement
Find the error in the following proof that 2 = 1. Consider the equation a =
- b. Multiply both sides by a to obtain a2 = ab. Subtract b2 from both sides to get a2−b2 = ab−b2. Now factor each side, (a+b)(a−b) = b(a−b), and divide each side by (a−b) to get a+b =
- b. Finally, let a and b equal 1, which shows that 2 = 1.
