# Solution: Exercise 0.10

## Solution
Step 1:
To prove: 2 = 1
Given proof is:
• Consider the equation
• Multiply both sides by a to obtain
• Subtract from both sides to get
• Now factor each side,
• Divide each side by , to get
• Let a and b equal 1, which shows that 2 = 1.
Step 2:
The fallacy lies in the step which involves division by , which is zero. Since a is equal to b as stated in the problem statement, a – b gives zero. Since division by zero is undefined, the argument cannot be considered as valid.
